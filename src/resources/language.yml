    wand-command: 'This command gives you the most legendary tool ever seen - by me: The Maze Wand! \n\nClick two blocks on the ground to create clipboard (that''s a rectangle or circle). Click and drag a blue corner of the clipboard to resize it. This clipboard can be converted to a maze floor with /tangledmaze start.'
    start-command: Converts your clipboard into the floor plan of a maze. This floor plan can now be edited by adding/cutting away other clipboards from it (/tangledmaze add/cut) or with the brush tool (/tangledmaze select brush).
    discard-command: Discards your floor plan and your clipboard.
    select-command: 'Lets you choose between different tools to edit floor plan of your maze. Following tools can be selected:'
    tools:
        rectangle: The shape of your clipboards will form rectangles.
        circle: Your clipboards will form circles.
        brush: Left click on the outline of your floor plan to reduce it at that block. Right click on the outline to expand it at that block.
        exit: Sets exits (or entrances) for your maze. Click on the outline of your floor plan to set an exit, click it a second time to delete it again. The diamond exit shows where maze generator will start making paths from.
    add-cut-command: 'Adds or cuts away your clipboard from your floor plan. This only works if the clipboard is touching your maze. In areas cut off from the main part of your maze with the diamond exit there won''t be generated any paths (just don''t).'
    undo-command: Undoes the last change to your maze like adding or cutting a clipboard away or usage of the brush tool.
    pathwidth-wallwidth-wallheight-command: These three commands are for changing the width of maze paths and walls as well as the wall height for the generation in the end.
    pathlength-command: This command affects for how many times a path will try to expand in one direction in your maze. Depending on the size of your maze a shorter paths (1) or longer paths (10) may look more esthetic.
    build-command: 'Builds your maze out of a mixture of blocks you enter. Type in the name of each block you want your maze to be built of (and &2":" &a+ &2a number &aif necessary), for example:\n &2"/maze build quartz_block:1" &a(that''s chiseled quartz).'
    teleport-command: Teleports you back to your floor plan (if you have the permission for that).
